        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div className="modal-body">
          <p>
            <strong>Afnan (ÿ£ŸÅŸÜÿßŸÜ)</strong> was born from the shared passion of four students at the 
            Lebanese American University (LAU), brought together by our love for nature and our drive 
            to create something meaningful through software engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            As plant enthusiasts and tech dreamers, we envisioned a space where anyone ‚Äî whether a 
            beginner or an expert ‚Äî could find the inspiration, tools, and community to nurture 
            their own little corner of green.
          </p>
          <p>
            Balancing our studies with late-night brainstorming sessions, we poured our hearts into 
            building a platform that not only simplifies plant care but also brings people closer to nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Afnan, we believe that small steps ‚Äî like planting a seed ‚Äî can lead to beautiful, 
            lasting change. üå±
          </p>
          <p>
            We are proud to invite you to grow with us.

            <h3>Do I need to create an account?</h3>
            <p>
              While some features are available without an account, creating an account allows you to track your plants,

              The Plant Tracker allows you to maintain a digital record of your plants including watering schedules, 
              fertilization dates, growth progress, and health status. You can set reminders and track the care history 
              of each of your plants.

            <p>
              You can use our plant identification feature by uploading a clear photo of your plant. Our system will 
              analyze the image and provide you with the most likely plant identification along with care information.

              costs vary depending on location. Orders over $50 qualify for free shipping within the continental United States.
